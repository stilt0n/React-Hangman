# React-Hangman

## About the app
This is a hangman game, you get six guesses for randomly chosen words (within character range).  You can play the game
on https://react-hang-man.herokuapp.com.  If you want to play the game locally, then clone the repo, npm install and
then npm start.

## What I learned
I got some more practice using React with this one and got to practice using state and props in a simple app.
